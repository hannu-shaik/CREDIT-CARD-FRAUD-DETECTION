# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION

This Python script seems to be a comprehensive example of data import, preprocessing, and building a decision tree model for fraud detection. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Data Import and Preprocessing**:
   - The script begins by importing necessary libraries and setting up environment variables.
   - It then downloads data from a specified source (fraud-detection) and unzips/tars it into the '/kaggle/input' directory.
   - The downloaded dataset is then read into a pandas DataFrame and initial preprocessing steps are performed.
   - Missing values in numeric columns are imputed, assuming certain strategies such as filling with median or 0 for binary variables.
   - Factorization (label encoding) is applied to categorical variables.

2. **Decision Tree Model Building**:
   - The dataset is split into features (X) and target variable (y).
   - Train-test split is performed with a 70-30 ratio.
   - A decision tree classifier is instantiated and trained on the training data.
   - Predictions are made on the test data.
   - Accuracy and classification report (including precision, recall, F1-score) are computed and printed.


3. **GitHub README Description**:
   - For the GitHub README file, you can structure the description as follows:
     - Introduction: Briefly introduce the purpose of the script (fraud detection) and its components.
     - Data Import and Preprocessing: Describe how the data is fetched, uncompressed, and preprocessed.
     - Model Building: Explain how the decision tree model is constructed, trained, and evaluated.
     - Usage: Mention any specific instructions or dependencies for running the script.
     - Example Output: Provide an example of the output or results obtained from running the script.
     - Credits and License: Give credit to the original author or data source, and specify the license if applicable.

By following this structure, users will have a clear understanding of what the script does and how to use it for their own purposes.
